## ðŸŽ¯ Conclusion

The comprehensive analysis shows three viable paths forward:

1. **Hardware Upgrade**: Best for long-term value and performance
2. **Cloud Migration**: Best for immediate relief and flexibility
3. **Hybrid Solution**: Best for short-term relief and decision flexibility

**Recommended Path**: Start with Hybrid Solution (already in progress), evaluate for 2-3 weeks, then make final decision based on performance needs and budget constraints.

The automated space management system is already providing immediate relief, and the hybrid approach will allow for informed decision-making while maintaining development productivity.

**Next Steps**: Execute the hybrid solution, monitor performance, and make hardware/cloud decision within 30 days based on actual usage and experience.
